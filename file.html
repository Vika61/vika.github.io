She rose to fame for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious  and Sam & Cat . She subsequently signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,Yours Truly , topped the US Billboard 200 chart, while its lead single, "The Way", charted in the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey for her wide vocal range and whistle register.Grande maintained her pop and R&B sound on her second and third studio albums, My Everything  and Dangerous Woman   with the former exploring EDM and producing the UK number-one singles "Problem", and "Bang Bang", and the latter becoming her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK Singles Chart. Her personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener   and Thank U, Next  , which were both critical and commercial successes.
